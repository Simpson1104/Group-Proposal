    "# Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is a class of disease that involves the heart or blood vessels. the number one cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our question is can we determine heart disease status based on quantifiable variables. This dataset we will be using is a tabular data set with comma-separated variables. It has 12 variables, but we will be only using 8 variables: age, sex, Chest Pain Type, cholesterol level, old peak, resting blood pressure, maximum heart rate, and Heart Disease in order to answer our question. \n",

    "Based on this information we will be using age, sex, chest pain type, maximum heart rate,  as the predictor variables. So far we have only used a maximum of 2 predictor variables in this course. But later on in the final report, we plan on using multivariable linear regression to predict whether a person has heart disease or not that will take into account all of the predictor variables. We can also chnage the background color ti plot what the classifer will likely predict as we saw in the reading for week 7."

    "# Expected outcomes and significance:\n",
    "We expect to find that the 4 predictor variables: age, sex, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate will help us tell if a person has heart disease or not, as there's a strong correlation between each predictor variable and heart disease. The impact of these findings would be very significant. People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help. In the future, we should try to improve the accuracy of the overall algorithm by adding more predictor variables and having a large sample scale for the data. This same technique can then be applied to detect other types of diseases such as pneumonia in patients. The algorithm removes human error and there's very little chance of the algorithm misdiagnosing someone if it has a strong accuracy.  "
